NAME
    GeoIP2 - Perl API for MaxMind's GeoIP2 web services

VERSION
    version 0.0100

DESCRIPTION
    This is an alpha release, and APIs may change before the final
    production release, which will be numbered 2.0000.

    This distribution provides an API for the GeoIP2 web services (as
    documented at http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services).

    In the future, this distribution will also provide the same API for the
    GeoIP2 downloadable databases. These databases have not yet been
    released as a downloadable product.

    See GeoIP2::Webservice::Client for details on the web service client
    API.

INTEGRATION WITH GEONAMES
    GeoNames (http://www.geonames.org/) offers web services and downloadable
    databases with data on geographical features around the world, including
    populated places. They offer both free and paid premium data. Each
    feature is unique identified by a "geoname_id", which is an integer.

    Many of the records returned by the GeoIP web services and databases
    include a "geoname_id" field. This is the ID of a geographical feature
    (city, region, country, etc.) in the GeoNames database.

    Some of the data that MaxMind provides is also sourced from GeoNames. We
    source data such as place names, ISO codes, and other similar data from
    the GeoNames premium data set.

REPORTING DATA PROBLEMS
    If the problem you find is that an IP address is incorrectly mapped,
    please submit your correction to MaxMind at
    http://www.maxmind.com/en/correction.

    If you find some other sort of mistake, like an incorrect spelling,
    please check the GeoNames site (http://www.geonames.org/) first. Once
    you've searched for a place and found it on the GeoNames map view, there
    are a number of links you can use to correct data ("move", "edit",
    "alternate names", etc.). Once the correction is part of the GeoNames
    data set, it will be automatically incorporated into future MaxMind
    releases.

    If you are a paying MaxMind customer and you're not sure where to submit
    a correction, please contact MaxMind support at for help. See
    http://www.maxmind.com/en/support for support details.

VERSIONING POLICY
    This module uses semantic versioning as described by http://semver.org/.
    Version numbers can be read as X.YYZZ, where X is the major number, YY
    is the minor number, and ZZ is the patch number.

PERL VERSION SUPPORT
    MaxMind has tested this API with Perl 5.8.8 and above. Reasonable
    patches for earlier versions of Perl 5.8 will be applied. We will not
    accept patches to support any version of Perl before 5.8.

    The data returned from the GeoIP2 web services includes Unicode
    characters in several languages. This may expose bugs in earlier
    versions of Perl. If Unicode support is important to you, we recommend
    that you use the most recent version of Perl available.

SUPPORT
    Please report all issues with this code using the GitHub issue tracker
    at https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-perl/issues

    If you are having an issue with a MaxMind service that is not specific
    to the client API please see http://www.maxmind.com/en/support for
    details.
