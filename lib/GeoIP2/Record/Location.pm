=head1 NAME

GeoIP2::Record::Location - Contains data for the location record associated with an IP address

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0200

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use 5.008;

  use GeoIP2::WebService::Client;

  my $client = GeoIP2::WebService::Client->new(
      user_id     => 42,
      license_key => 'abcdef123456',
  );

  my $city = $client->city_isp_org( ip => '24.24.24.24' );

  my $location_rec = $city->location();
  say $location_rec->name();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains the location data associated with an IP address.

This record is returned by all the end points except the Country end point.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 $location_rec->accuracy_radius()

This returns the radius in kilometers around the specified location where the
IP address is likely to be.

This attribute is only available from the Omni end point.

=head2 $location_rec->latitude()

This returns the latitude of the location as a floating point number.

This attribute is returned by all end points except the Country end point.

=head2 $location_rec->longitude()

This returns the longitude of the location as a floating point number.

This attribute is returned by all end points except the Country end point.

=head2 $location_rec->metro-code()

This returns the metro code of the location if the location is in the US.
MaxMind returns the same metro codes as the Google AdWords API
(https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/cities-DMAregions).

This attribute is returned by all end points except the Country end point.

=head2 $location_rec->postal_code()

This returns the postal code of the location. Postal codes are not available
for all countries. In some countries, this will only contain part of the
postal code.

This attribute is returned by all end points except the Country end point.

=head2 $location_rec->postal_confidence()

This returns a value from 0-100 indicating MaxMind's confidence that the
postal code is correct.

This attribute is only available from the Omni end point.

=head2 $location_rec->time_zone()

This returns the time zone associated with location, as specified by the IANA
Time Zone Database (http://www.iana.org/time-zones), e.g., "America/New_York".

This attribute is returned by all end points except the Country end point.
